## Description  
- **Overview**: Provides a high-level understanding of the lab's purpose and objectives.  
- **Lab Build**: Details the installation and configuration of the Active Directory environment.  
- **Attack Vectors**: Explains initial attack simulations, such as smb relay attacks, LLMNR Poisoning and brute force.  
- **Post-Compromise Mitigation**: Demonstrates recovery steps and securing the environment.


## Key Takeaways  
- Developed skills in Active Directory configuration and management.  
- Gained hands-on experience with common attack vectors and their mitigation.  
- Strengthened knowledge of network defense strategies.
